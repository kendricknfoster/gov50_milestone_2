Project 1: Regional Inequality in Slovak Education, by Matej Cerman

This project has engaging visualizations and maps, with a model that allows you
to select between the different outcome variable. This approach allows us to get
a better grasp of the impact of average gross income on education across
multiple dimensions. However, I would have liked to see an explanation of
factors that go into the overall rating of various Slovak schools, and I would
have liked to see some sort of multivariate regression. Also, why is the effect
of average gross impact so much stronger for regions than for individual
schools?
